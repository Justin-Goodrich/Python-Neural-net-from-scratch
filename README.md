# Python-Nueral-net-from-scratch

this project is the result of my first dive into machine learning. I decided to create my own basic feed-forward neural network from scratch (still using numpy for matrix multiplication) so that I could learn how machine learning actually works
I'm also going to be explaining some of the concepts on here to further develeop my understanding of nueral networks.

## How it Works
